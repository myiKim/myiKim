- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @myiKim, I have a deep passion for Machine Learning and its applications, particularly in the realm of animation algorithms. I am constantly exploring ways to leverage deep learning techniques to create more natural and realistic animations.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently interested in and working on ..
- - Animation algorithms with the assistance of Deep Neural Networks: I'm particularly focused on utilizing deep learning techniques to enhance animation in a more natural and realistic manner.
- - Generative Models (Image) such as GANs, VAEs, Diffusion models, etc.
- - Applying Reinforcement Learning Algorithms to other relevant areas, such as skeletal animation, etc.
- If you're interested in these topics, feel free to reach out to me.
